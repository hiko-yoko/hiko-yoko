Did you see the sky at night, when you are faraway from city? 
It is gorgeous!
Now people rare look up to the sky in everyday rootin. They just can't see how beautifull it is.
Maybe I'm romantic person, but you can't ignor that sky can completly change your mind.

Heaven may be vary formidable, clear but always inviting.You feel better when  you look up to the sky and think about something, dreaming.
Don't forget about this.
