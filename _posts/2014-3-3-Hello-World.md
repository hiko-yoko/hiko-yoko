title: Roles of different developers
---

First let's name them:
1 Engineer
2 Producer
3 Designer
4 Artist
5 Scientist 


We can imagine that everyone is a finger of our hand. Then which finger will everyone be?

1Engineer will be 3 if we count starting from thumb, because in most situations he plays really big role. He wrights code and puts everything together.
2 Producer will be the thumb, because he brings resources and clients. 
3 Designer will be 2 finger, because he pointing to aim, he showing to others what to do, gives direction.
4 Artist is the 5 finger. He creates look of product.
5 Scientist is the 4. He analyses what clients want to see, helps to do game or other product more realistic.
