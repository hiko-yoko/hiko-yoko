When we started creating design of our monster with Madina we wasn't thinking lot about  monster's look. 
First, we started searching in Google.

Next we took best parts of those monsters and created new design

When we starned writing code in Processing  it was hard, because we didn't understand wit—Åh numbes is changing picture and how.
But then while we was workin on progect it became easy,  but even though it took a lot of time.
While we worked on this progect Madina and I became a real team.

For me the most difficult part of that task was drawing triangles and Madina explained me.In my turn I helped her with arks.
Here is result.
I want to continue drawing monster, but program on my compurter is not working now. For now I just want to ahive bare minimum.
