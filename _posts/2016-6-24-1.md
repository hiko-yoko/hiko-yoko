First let's name them:
1 Engineer
2 Producer
3 Designer
4 Artist
5 Scientist 


We can imagine that everyone is a finger of our hand. Then which finger will everyone be?

1 Engineer will be 3 if we count starting from thumb, because in most situations he plays really big role. He wrights code and puts everything together.

2 Producer will be the thumb, because he brings resources and clients.

3 Designer will be 2 finger, because he pointing to aim, he showing to others what to do, gives direction.
