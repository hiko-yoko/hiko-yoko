Today we started working with arduino. It was couple work. My partner - Azim and I was workin with starting kit using instruction consided of 12 different constructions.
There is was problems with installing program to school computer, so we used Azims notebook. Finaly we finishd 10 out of 12. At the and of lesson we started working on 11 arduino progect, but there is was a problem with sensors.
This lesson was realy cool.I felt like a real engineeer.Chekig each wire, resistor, sensor again again and again angers litle bit, but always turns to fun.
Arduino - exiting robotics knowleg that helps in future.
