It is simple game made in processing.



Rules: 
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. 

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. 

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. 

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.





Wining condition: you have to put 3 X or O together



Story:Noughts and Crosses is a game that has been played for several centuries - even if it's precise history seems unknown. The game has become known (perhaps more popularly) as Tic Tac Toe in American English.

It may be that the ancient Roman game of Terni Lapilli was an identical game although the evidence is somewhat mixed. It is certainly true that identical grids to the noughts and crosses grid have been found scratched and etched into surfaces all over the ancient Roman empire.

However not a single Nought or Cross has been found to confirm the link. It seems probable that Terni Lapilli was played with simple pieces and may have been played with the same rules.
