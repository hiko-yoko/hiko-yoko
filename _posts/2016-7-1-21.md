This course was cool. I liked it. We learned more abot games, studied programing, we became real team where all help each other.
All progrems that we were working with  like Twine, Processing, Piskel, Sploder, Jekyll and Github  were not compliated because miss Sherol's explanations and friends help. 
I'll miss those guys, who are from other cities and espesialy miss Sherol. And communicate more with thouse, who are from Almaty.
This course ended, but I'll continue studing programig myself and  immprove pixel art skills.
I hope we meet again!!!
